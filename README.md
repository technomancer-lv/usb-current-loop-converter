What's this project for?

Current loop communication interface is used in various old computing equipment - computers, terminals, printers and other devices. This converter is made to let these devices interface with modern comuters over USB port. It's based on CP2101 USB-serial bridge and can work up to 9600 baud. It's tested as working with soviet made PDP-11 compatible boards MS1201.01, 02, 03, with serial interface UPO, with terminals MS6102.02 and 15IE.
