What's this project for?

Current loop communication interface is used in various old computing equipment - computers, terminals, printers and other devices. This converter is made to let these devices interface with modern comuters over USB port. It's based on CP2101 USB-serial bridge and can work up to 9600 baud.It's tested as working with soviet made PDP-11 compatible boards MS1201.01, 02, 03, with serial interfaces UPO, KTLK, KTLK-6 and also with terminals MS6102.02 and 15IE.

Converter is made as completed device in case that need only USB and current loop serial connections. Status of Tx, Rx, RTS and CTS lines are displayed on LEDs. Also, RTS and CTS signals can be forced to be active using DIP switches.
