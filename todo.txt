Workflow 2020:
	Sort out connector problem, get the right ones
	Sort out problem with incorrect panels - panels need to be cut out asap
	Remodel cardboard insert (12.02)
	Order lasercut cardboard insert (13.02)
	Order boxes (12.02)
	Solder switches (12.02)
	Clean boards
	Mark as tested with SN
	Make packing inserts (30.01)
	Make cables
	Make loopback plugs (26.01)
	Solder adapter boards
	Fix one badly reflowed board (27.01)
	Sort out dim LED problem in a few boards
	Test all sets
	Put all in boxes
	Sell 8pcs
	
	Add finished set pictures here

v1.2:	sch:
	BOM should be re-checked when finished - count, values, links
      
  another small PCB for 8-pin connector
	check if everything fits and works on 1201, UPO and I12 boards
	also make 8pin-DE9M adapter for I12 (witn insulators?) (unrelated to CL, only RS232)
    
  make full documentation
  make BOM
  proper testing (MS1201.01 .02 .03, terminals)
  cable pinouts for various devices and loopback cable
  better assembly drawing
    
  make set for sale
    minor changes for box cardboard insert
      different bending marks
    make pictures with packed up set
    make pictures with new version and adapter boards
    
Maybe cheap lite version with no case, no RST/CTS, all DIP?
    With cheap ebay UART module
    Component values on board
    Sold as simple board to be assembled by buyer

Design a convertor for RS232-IRPS
Maybe one with BK KMK module compatible pinout?
Maybe one with MC6102 optical UART compatibility?

Issues:
  A bit incorrect resistor numbering at the CL connector. Fix in next release if there will be one.
