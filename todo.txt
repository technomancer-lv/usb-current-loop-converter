v1.2:
  _ order 3 different connectors from svinka (ordered, available, order has to be shipped)
  prototype:
    X prototype pulse stretcher for Tx and Rx LEDs (0,1s) (prototype second version with 7407)
    prototype 7407 as replacement for transistors
    prototype faster optocouplers (with resistor on primary side)
  high current paths from Vusb?
  rts/cts change to dtr/dcr?
  higher speed - 19200 at least. Test TCMT1103 couplers
  recalculate signal path currents
  recalculate overall current form 3,3V pin
  recalculate resistor power
  maybe smaller protection resistors
  USB mini - SMD
  make pcb v1.2
    pulse stretcher
    X mini-USB connector pads on top layer
    X disconnect pins 1 and 10 from CL connector
    raccoon drawing!
    reuse v1.0 as much as possible
  another small PCB for 8-pin connector (with raccoon!)
    two versions are ready to be ordered, still have to check if everything fits
  make all documentation
  make gerber files
  make BOM
  proper testing (MS1201.02 .02 .03, terminals)
  cable pinouts for various devices and loopback cable
  better assembly drawing
  order parts
    cases
    dipswitches
    LEDs
    protection diodes
    7407
    optocouplers
    passive parts
    front and back panels (lasercutting)
    stickers
  make set for sale
    find proper box
    lasercut cardboard insert for box
    stickers!
