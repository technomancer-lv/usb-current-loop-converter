Workflow 2020:
	Finish the right connector order (17.02)
	Put stickers on panels and cases (18.02)
	Prepare boxes with inserts
	Fix one badly reflowed board (27.01)
	Sort out dim LED problem in a few boards
	Clean boards
	Mark as tested with SN
	Make packing inserts (30.01)
	Make cables (17.02)
	Make loopback plugs (17.02)
	Solder adapter boards (5 done, waiting for connectors)
	Test all sets
	Put all in boxes (converter, small board, loopback plug, interface cable, USB cable, sticker)
	Sell 8pcs
	
	Add finished set pictures here

v1.2:	sch:
	BOM should be re-checked when finished - count, values, links
      
  another small PCB for 8-pin connector
	check if everything fits and works on 1201, UPO and I12 boards (UPO tested)
	also make 8pin-DE9M adapter for I12 (witn insulators?) (unrelated to CL, only RS232)
    
  make full documentation
  make BOM
  proper testing (MS1201.01 .02 .03, terminals)
  cable pinouts for various devices and loopback cable
  better assembly drawing
    
  make set for sale
    make pictures with packed up set
    make pictures with new version and adapter boards
    
Maybe cheap lite version with no case, no RST/CTS, all DIP?
    With cheap ebay UART module
    Component values on board
    Sold as simple board to be assembled by buyer

Design a convertor for RS232-IRPS
Maybe one with BK KMK module compatible pinout?
Maybe one with MC6102 optical UART compatibility?

Issues:
  A bit incorrect resistor numbering at the CL connector. Fix in next release if there will be one.
