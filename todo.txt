v1.2:
  prototype:
    buy all parts needed for prototyping
    prototype faster optocouplers (with resistor on primary side)
  higher speed - 19200 at least. Test TCMT1103 couplers
  recalculate signal path currents
  recalculate overall current from 3,3V pin
  recalculate resistor power
  find replacements for protection diodes
  make pcb v1.2
    Use dtr/dsr pins? What makes minicom show Online?
      sch:
      Maybe LEDs side by side
      optocouplers different
      output diodes different
      find what to use instead of EOL transils
      two capacitors should be 0,22 instead of 0,1
      BOM should be re-checked when finished - count, values, links
      R25,26 should be changed RefDes, so on PCB should be fixed too
      
      pcb:
      test if USB connector really fits
      move avay traces where DRC marks as error
      Stencil
      First pin markings 7407, couplers
      
  another small PCB for 8-pin connector
    two versions are ready to be ordered, still have to check if everything fits
    more adaptors for UPO, I12, KTLK boards
  tweak pulse stretcher time on real board
  make all documentation
  make gerber files
  make BOM
  proper testing (MS1201.01 .02 .03, terminals)
  cable pinouts for various devices and loopback cable
  better assembly drawing
  order parts
    cases
    dipswitches
    protection diodes
    74LVC07
    optocouplers
    front and back panels (lasercutting)
    stickers
  make set for sale
    minor changes for box cardboard insert
    stickers!
    10pin cables
    loopback connectors
    make pictures with packed up set
    make pictures with new version and adapter boards
    
Maybe cheap lite version with no case, no RST/CTS, all DIP?
