v1.2:
  prototype pulse stretcher for Tx and Rx LEDs (0,1s)
  recalculate signal path currents
  recalculate resistor power
  maybe smaller protection resistors
  make pcb v1.2
    pulse stretcher
    raccoon drawing!
    reuse v1.0 as much as possible
  another small PCB for 8-pin connector
  make all documentation
  make gerber files
  make BOM
  proper testing (MS1201.02 .02 .03, terminals)
  cable pinouts for various devices and loopback cable
  better assembly drawing
